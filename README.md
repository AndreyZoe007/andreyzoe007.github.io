<h1>Andrey Zoe's BLOG Website</h1>	
こんにちは、みんな I am Andrey Zoe or you can call me Zoe. I am a high school student eager to learn Japanese. Learn, speak, and write the language so that I can communicate with Japanese people when I go to Japan in the future.

My future of going to Japan is not just about the language but also the culture. Japan is a diverse country with lots of different cultures throughout the country. That excites me a lot to what I am looking forward to learning.
